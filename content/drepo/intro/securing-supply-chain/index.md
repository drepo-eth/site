## Clear and Present Danger to the Software Supply Chain

In general, any manipulation to any element of the software supply chain puts
the whole software ecosystem in danger and can cause serious damage.
This is not just limited to other software projects but also affects the real
world as basically everything and everyone is somewhat dependent of software in
our modern world.
This can range from the inconvenience of not being able to pay with your phone
to the catastrophic failure of essential infrastructure causing countless
deaths.
