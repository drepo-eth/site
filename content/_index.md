Software repositories are essential elements of the global software supply
chain. They are often the central software distribution points within their
respective ecosystems.

This centralization makes the repositories and consequently the supply chain as
a whole vulnerable to various threats. Decentralization can mitigate these
risks.

The decentralized software repository (_dRepo_) that is depicted on this site
offers software developers and everyday consumers a more secure and reliable
system.
It is owned and operated by the community and cannot be stopped or manipulated
by anyone.
In typical web3 manner, the system is simplistic and extensible allowing it to
integrate well with current and future infrastructure.
Its openness and ubiquity changes the way applications are built and delivered.
