Software repositories are essential elements of the global software supply
chain. Moreover, they are often the central hub for software distribution within
their respective ecosystems.

This centralization leaves the repositories and supply chain vulnerable to
various threats. Decentralization can mitigate these risks.

As depicted on this site, the decentralized software repository (_dRepo_) offers
software developers and everyday consumers a more secure and reliable system. It
is owned and operated by the community and cannot be stopped or manipulated by
anyone. In a typical web3 manner, the design is simplistic and extensible,
allowing it to integrate well with current and future infrastructure. Its
openness and ubiquity change the way applications are built and delivered.
