Software repositories are essential elements of the global software supply
chain. They are often the central software distribution points within their
respective ecosystems.

This centralization makes the repositories and consequently the supply chain as
a whole vulnerable to various threats. Decentralization can mitigate these
risks.

The decentralized software repository (_dRepo_) as depicted on this site offers
software developers and everyday consumers a more secure and reliable system. It
is owned and operated by the community and cannot be stopped or manipulated by
anyone. In typical web3 manner, the system is simplistic and extensible allowing
it to integrate well with current and future infrastructure. Its openness and
ubiquity changes the way applications are built and delivered.
