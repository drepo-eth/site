</h2><p>This section does not actually address software repositories but rather content
repositories that are mostly known for distributing copyrighted content.
However, due to their resilience a decentralized repository should adopt some of
their features. We also ignore group sites and the release system in this

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent" title="BitTorrent" target="_blank">BitTorrent</a> has been
around for almost two decades and is still widely used, even in corporate
settings. It is a peer-to-peer file-sharing network, which allows users to share
arbitrary files that are identified using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage" title="Content Addressing" target="_blank">Content Addressing</a>.
Applying a hashing function to the content of a file creates a rather unique
value that is used to identify files. This <em>content address</em> is subsequently
used in <code>.torrent</code> files and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme" title="Magnet URI Scheme" target="_blank">magnet links</a>
to share pointers to files.</p>
<p>Another popular distribution system is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet" title="Usenet" target="_blank">Usenet</a>, which holds various
newsgroups. It was originally used to post text content and is the spiritual
predecessor of online forums or, for example,
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/" title="Reddit" target="_blank">Reddit</a>. Arbitrary files are posted in the
form of encoded text, which is similar to the mechanism used for email file
attachments. A file is usually split into multiple text messages which are
identified by server-generated ids. Similar to <code>.torrent</code> files, <code>.nzb</code> files
are used to address these individual messages.</p>
<p>The Usenet itself is hosted using various service providers that each hold a
copy of the entire system and synchronize the data among each other.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
While the BitTorrent network is publicly and free-of-charge accessible,
accessing the Usenet usually requires a paid account with an Usenet provider.</p>

<p>Trackers and indexers are used to find and share content stored in these
unstructured systems. They are separate, centralized systems that are often
represented as websites. They allow users to search for content and obtain the
respective magnet links, <code>.torrent</code>, or <code>.nzb</code> files.</p>
<p>Even though the community is somewhat organized, there is no central authority
that declares an indexer as the standard or a piece of content as the valid one.
This means that there exist multiple indexers and trackers and also multiple
versions of the same content in, for example, different formats or qualities.
Consequently, there is a many-to-many relationship between indexers and content.
Indexers might reference the same files or different ones, still representing
the same content.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="resilience">Resilience 
  <a class="anchor" href="#resilience">
    <i class="bi bi-link-45deg"></i>
  </a>
</h2><p>Due to copyright laws, law enforcement is interested in taking down both the
content and the indexers, even though the latter does not hold any copyrighted
content.</p>
<p>As trackers and indexers are for the most part centralized services, they are
fairly easy to identify. Consequently, taking them down, as long as legal
grounds and measures exist, is also straightforward. However, this measure only
removes a single tracker instance. Its data is mostly publicly available and
more importantly, separated from the actual content. Another instance can easily
replace it without any actual disturbance to the overall system.</p>

<p>Files in the BitTorrent network can essentially never be removed as there is no
central, addressable point of failure to exploit.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Thus, peers that
share files containing copyrighted material are being targeted and taken down in
an attempt to remove the files from the network. Since the p2p network
communicates openly, one can identify the IP addresses of peers sharing specific
data. From here, law enforcement can find the real identities of participating
peers.</p>
<p>Another possibility is to block the BitTorrent network traffic altogether
through ISPs. Such a measure, however, is fairly broad and would prevent using
the system for other legal purposes. Additionally, circumventing this blockade
is rather trivial.</p>
<p>The usage of VPNs and other privacy-preserving technologies can not only evade
the aforementioned network blockage but also hide the real identity of peers
within the open network. This makes it impossible to track down all peers
sharing a specific file.</p>

<p>Takedowns of copyrighted material are handled differently on the Usenet.
Take-down notices are issued to the Usenet providers that are legally bound to
comply. They consequently delete the messages in question from their servers.</p>
<p>To fight this removal, the community takes multiple measures to keep content
available. As the files or messages in question are often not completely removed
from all the existing providers but only in part, chances are that a large chunk
of the files is still available. Combining the files from different providers
might result in a complete file. Additionally, since the synchronization between
providers is sometimes not perfect or the upload process partially fails, it is
common to provide parity data for files. This allows the recovery of partially
incomplete files, which might also do the trick in this case.</p>
<p>If a file is unrecoverable, it is often simply re-uploaded, making the content
available yet again. Nevertheless, this entails that the content is actually new
and references must be shared across indexers.</p>
<p>The third measure is the obfuscation of uploaded content. This might include
using random names for files and possibly uploading across various newsgroups.
Thus, it is harder to identify the content and all of its parts. An indexer or a
<code>.nzb</code> file is necessary to find the desired content without having to analyze
the data on the Usenet. As this scheme requires indexers to find content, still
valid content might get &rsquo;lost&rsquo; if an indexer becomes unavailable and the content
is not referenced anywhere else.</p>
