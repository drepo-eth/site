<p>However, there have been multiple incidents in the past involving software
repositories which are cause for concern.
Most notably:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>youtube-dl DMCA Takedown on GitHub</strong>
(<a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/10/2020-10-23-RIAA.md">Claim</a>):
The RIAA issued a DMCA takedown notice due to copyright claims to GitHub
forcing them to block youtube-dl and its forks on the platform. GitHub and
its owner Microsoft later reinstated the Git repositories
(<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571473/github-youtube-dl-downloader-riaa-copyright-1201-takedown-reinstated">Article</a>)
and promised to defend open source software in the future.</li>
<li><strong>faker.js and color.js rollback</strong> (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/9/22874949/developer-corrupts-open-source-libraries-projects-affected">The Verge
Article</a>):
The author of these two libraries actively sabotaged them and released new
versions which were partially added to software projects due to not pinning
and blind automation. This caused a lot of chaos and confusion. Consequently
the NPM registry reverted the malicious versions while GitHub apparently
also blocked the author&rsquo;s account.</li>
<li><strong>Tornado Cash sanctioned by U.S. Treasury</strong> (<a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/circle-github-comply-with-tornado-cash-sanctions/">Article
1</a>,
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/08/treasury-tornado-cash-laundering-stolen-crypto/">Article
2</a>
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/12/23298217/tornado-cash-crypto-mixer-crackdown-authorities-arrest-suspected-developer-amsterdam">Article 3</a>):
Popular on-chain privacy-preserving mixer-protocol Tornado Cash was
santioned by the U.S. Treasury due to money laundering concerns.
These santions prohibit U.S. citizens and companies to interact with the
Tornado Cash entity as well as with the on-chain smart contracts, which is
the first time that blockchain addresses are sanctioned.
This triggered GitHub to suspend the public open source repositories
of Tornado Cash as well as the user accounts of any user who contributed to
the repositories.
Furthermore, the centralized domain of the protocol was suspended while the
decentralized ENS domain continued to function by serving the frontend via
IPFS.
Centralized stable coin provider <a href="https://www.circle.com/">Circle</a> (USDC)
froze all user funds within the protocol and node access provider
<a href="https://infura.io/">Infura</a> and <a href="https://www.alchemy.com/">Alchemy</a> blocked
access to the smart contracts through their services.
Other decentralized applications like <a href="https://aave.com/">Aave</a> started to
abide to the santions freely, preventing wallet addresses which used Tornado
Cash in the past from accessing their services.
In the following days one of the developers was arrested in the Netherlands
on charges of money laundering.</li>
</ul>
<p>Such incidents<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> at this magnitude are very rare but they show the importance of
repositories and other centralized infrastructure in software development as
well as the power that lies with those who manage them.</p>
<h2 id="threats">Threats</h2>
<p>It does not matter whether or not you agree with the actions that were taken.
The fact of the matter is that the popular software repositories we use
day-to-day are not just centralized software applications but are also owned
and managed by centralized entities that are incorporated in the offline world.
Hence, they are bound to local and national laws while also pursuing commercial
interests.
Even if they would pledge to uphold the interests of the global software
development community, their own interests will always come first.</p>
<p>This leaves software repositories and the software they host vulnerable to not
just cyber-attacks, but also to threats due to legal, political, and economic
pressure.
Handling DDoS attacks and hacks is a developers daily business, but fending off
law suits and blackmail is definitely not.
And if you are anything like us, you would very much like to stay as far away
as possible from such topics.</p>
<h3 id="censorship">Censorship</h3>
<p>Imagine you are an awesome software developer who created an app, that is used
and loved by millions.
At the same time, your software might be utilized by people for activities
which are illegal in some countries.
The administrators of some software repositories could be compelled by law
enforcement to block access to your software either in those countries or even
globally.
The latter is especially dangerous as a single government could cripple the
global software supply chain.</p>
<h3 id="manipulation">Manipulation</h3>
<p>Even more dangerous is the possibility of manipulation.
Few developers actually verify downloaded artifacts by for example comparing
the checksum with the value provided directly by the developer.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
Some dependency tools perform these checks based on data provided by the
repository and this is actually a problem.
If the repository acts maliciously, it could change the artifact and checksum
to introduce arbitrary code into dependent projects without many people
noticing.</p>
<h2 id="centralized-power">Centralized Power</h2>
<p>As we all know: <em>With great power comes great responsibility</em>.
A centralized system millions of people depend on which is controlled by a
single centralized entity is fine as long as everybody is happy and we love and
respect one another.</p>
<p>This essentially means that we are in for a disaster sooner or later.</p>
